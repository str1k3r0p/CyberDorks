CyberDorks is an advanced Google dork generator tool aimed at security professionals and bug bounty hunters. This tool leverages various advanced search queries ("dorks") to help you find exposed files, vulnerable configurations, and other sensitive information on the web.

## Features

- **Quick Dork Generation:** Easily generate key dorks by entering a domain or a personâ€™s name.
- **Bug Bounty Dorks:** Comprehensive list of queries for discovering vulnerable endpoints, exposed files, admin panels, and more.
- **People Search Dorks:** Specialized dorks to help find information related to individuals (e.g., email addresses, profiles, resumes).
- **Dashboard Interface:** Intuitive GUI with a sidebar for navigation and real-time updates.
- **Export Options:** Copy generated dorks to clipboard or export them as TXT/CSV files.
- **Dynamic Background Effect:** A background canvas with animated particles for a modern look.
